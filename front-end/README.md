# API

I created my own API from webscraping multiple hospital websites and obtaining physicians. I also webscraped a website that listed most of the hospitals in Colorado.

I aslo used a news API to get news relevant to Emergency responders. Which is displayed at the "Home" tab.

# Functionality

In this app a user is able to register/login and rate a doctor on a star based system or hospital along with leaving a review. A user can also update/detele their account in the settings tab if logged in.
